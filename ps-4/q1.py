Note: Seems like they are all the same? So does this mean convergence occurs for many N? Seems like after 3 or 4 it matches, which kind of makes sense because of the x^4 in f. But what about the x's from e^x?? Maybe it gets deleted by the 1/(e^x - 1)^2, as, since they're both of infinite degree, it cancels.
